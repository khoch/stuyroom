Stuy room reservation system
Club/Pub Room Sign Up Website

* we want to make it really simple and user friendly because that is our biggest problem right now
* we need people to be signing up for rooms if they are using them!


First page:

	MASTERLIST: has calendar with SU rooms that are signed up for
	DATE FIRST: asks for which date you would like to reserve a room
	clubs must sign up for a room a minimum of 3 days in advance

Second page (once you have chosen a date):

	gives all rooms AVAILABLE on that date
	organized by floor
	map of the floor (ADD LINKS)
	maybe interactive and you click on the room you want?

Third page (the date and room are chosen):

	club leaders must submit:
	their name 
	club name
	email

Necessary Functions:

	•pick the date first then the rooms that appear to sign up for are only the rooms available on that date
	•cancel-able function a minimum of 24 hours in advance
	•once a room is successfully signed up for, it appears on the calendar from the first page (and on the SU website?)
	•organize rooms by floor
	•map of the floor
	•(possible) fun addition: make the map interactive and you can click on rooms to either sign up for them or see who/when is going to occupy that room.
	
Things we need:

	• updated list of all the SU approved rooms (floors 2-4)
	• updated list of all the AIS rooms so we DO NOT offer them

Roles:

	leader: Krzysztof
	backend: Nicholas
	middleware/front end: Daisy
